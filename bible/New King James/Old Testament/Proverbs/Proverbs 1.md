### 1
The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:

### 2
To know wisdom and instruction,
to perceive the words of understanding,

### 3
To receive the instruction of wisdom,
Justice, judgment, and equity;

### 4
To give prudence to the simple,
To the young man knowledge and discretion---

### 5
A wise *man* will hear and increase learning,
And a man of understanding will attain wise counsel,

### 6
To understand a proverb and an enigma,
The words of the wise and their riddles.

### 7
The fear of the Lord *is* the beginning of knowledge,
*But* fools despise wisdom and instruction.

## Shun Evil Counsel

### 8
My son, hear the instruction of your father,
And do not forsake the law of your mother;

### 9
For they *will be* a graceful ornament on your head,
And chains around your neck.

### 10
My son, if sinners entice you,
Do not consent.

### 11
If they say, "Come with us,
Let us lie in wait to *shed* blood;
Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;

### 12
> [!aside|right show-title] a1
>  Or *the grave*
  
Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, **a1**
And whole, like those who go down to the Pit;

### 13
We shall find all kinds of precious possessions,
We shall fill our houses with spoil;

### 14

Cast in your lot among us,
Let us all have one purse"

### 15

My son, do not walk in the way with them,
Keep your foot from their path;

### 16

For their feet run to evil,
And they make haste to shed blood.

### 17

Surely, in vain the net is spread
In the sight of any bird;

### 18

But they lie in wait for their *own* blood,
They lurk secretly for their *own* lives.

### 19

So *are* the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain;
It takes away the life of it's owners.

## The Call of Wisdom

### 20

Wisdom calls aloud outside;
She raises her voice in the open squares.

### 21
> [!aside|right show-title] a2
>  Septuagint, Syriac, and Targum read *top of the walls*;
>  Vulgate reads *the head of multitudes*.
  
She cries out in the chief concourses, **a2**
At the openings of the gates in the city
She speaks her words:

### 22

"How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?
For scorners delight in their scorning,
And fools hate knowledge.

### 23

Turn at my rebuke;
Surely I will pour out my spirit on you;
I will make my words known to you.

### 24

Because I have already called and you refused,
I have streatched out my hand and no one regarded,

### 25

Because you disdained all my counsel,
And would have none of my rebuke,

### 26

I will also laugh at your calamity;
I will mock when your terror comes,

### 27

When your terror comes like a storm,
And your destruction comes like a whirlwind,
When distress and anguish come upon you.

### 28

"Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;
They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.

### 29

Because they hated knowledge
And did not choose the fear of the Lord,

### 30

They would have none of my counsel
And despised my every rebuke.

### 31

Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way,
And be filled to the full with their own fancies.

### 32

For the turning away of the simple sill slay them,
And the complacency of fools will destroy them;

### 33

But whoever listens to me will dwell safely,
And will be secure, without fear of evil."

## Commentary Section

### [[#5|v5]]

We cannot go to Scripture with the ulterior motive of getting our way or proving our position. We must be eager to learn from Scripture what the **Lord** intended for us to learn.
We must not be like Jeremiah's contemporaries who defiantly asserted: "We will not walk in it" and "We will not listen" [[Proverbs 6#16]]-17
