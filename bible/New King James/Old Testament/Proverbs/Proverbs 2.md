## The Value of Wisdom 

### 1

My son, if you recieve my words,
And treasure my commands within you,

### 2

So that you incline your ear to wisdom,
*And* apply your heart to understanding;

### 3

Yes, if you cry out for discernment,
*And* lift up your voice for understanding,

### 4

If you seek her as silver,
And search for her as *for* hidden treasure;

### 5

The you will understand the fear of the Lord,
And find the knowledge of God.

### 6

For the Lord gives wisdom;
From His mouth *come* knowledge and understanding;
