# NinjaSurge's Obsidian Bible Vault

This vault is supposed to be a template for others to use, I **should** be stripped of all personal studies and notes, but contain the workflows templates and layouts.

Most of the bible and all the lexicon and dictionary files are from the [Kingdom Study Tools for Obsidian](https://github.com/gapmiss/kingdom-study-tools-for-obsidian)
